      <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
      <p>Dear Interested Employer,</p>

  <p>
    I am looking for a <strong>Junior Full Stack Developer</strong> role. I have some hands-on experience building full stack applications using <strong>Node.js, Express, SQL, HTML, and CSS</strong>, including a membership and event management web app with secure login, dashboards, and admin features.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    My background as a <strong>CNC Programmer</strong> has given me extensive experience in logical programming, automation with macros, loops, and conditionals, as well as proficiency with Fusion 360, AutoCAD Inventor, and command line interfaces. These skills translate directly into software development, where problem-solving, attention to detail, and efficient coding are key.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    I am known for my <strong>exceptional work ethic</strong>, having taken only four sick days in the past six years, and for reliably completing projects efficiently, including overtime when required. I am mechanically minded, highly resourceful, and thrive in environments that require research, debugging, and delivering practical solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team and continue growing as a Full Stack Developer. Thank you for your time and consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Kind regards,<br>
  Ollie Adams</p>
